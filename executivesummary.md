Finally, developer receives the vulnerabilities and licenses results from Open Source management. <br>
In this system, developer sends the software package to Open Source Management to accept package. Package name then is sent to NIST Vulnerability database to check if there is an existing software package name. Package is also scanned by FOSSology to check licenses. Finally, both licenses and vulnerability results are stored in the license and vulnerability database where the manager can retrieve the information too. In addition, there is also a policy database for licenses and vulnerabilities database where manager can retrieve policy to create or update policy for license and vulnerabilities.<br>
